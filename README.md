# Mesh-Generation-Framework
The part of the project deals with a program code to create file formats of mesh in .vtk that can be visualized in an opensource visualization tool called PARAVIEW.

The project was later moved and merged with <a href="https://github.com/Turbulence-Master/MeshGeneration-Framework"> MeshGeneration-Framework @Turbulence-Master </a>.
